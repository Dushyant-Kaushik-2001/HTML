----------------------------------------------------------What is HTML?------------------------------------------------------------------------

HTML Kya Hai?
ðŸ”¹ HTML ka full form: HyperText Markup Language
ðŸ”¹ HTML ek markup language hai jo webpages banane ke liye use hoti hai.
ðŸ”¹ HTML ka kaam hai web pages ka structure define karna, jaise text, images, links, forms, etc.
ðŸ”¹ HTML me tags ka use hota hai jo browser ko batate hain ki content kaise dikhna chahiye.
ðŸ”¹ Example: Agar humein ek page banana hai jisme ek heading, ek paragraph aur ek image ho, toh hum HTML ka use karte hain.
jaise Jab hum kisi website ko open karte hain (jaise Google, YouTube, Facebook), to uska structure HTML se bana hota hai.

1. HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language.

2. HTML was created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991 as a standard for creating web pages.

3. It's a markup language used to structure content on the web, defining elements like headings, paragraphs, links, and images. 

4. HTML forms the backbone of web content. 

5. In layman's terms, HTML is like the skeleton of a website. It's a set of instructions that tells a web browser how to display text, 
images, videos, and other elements on a webpage. Think of it as the building blocks that create the structure and look of a website, 
similar to how bricks and mortar are used to build a house.

6. In a nutshell:

(a). HTML is the foundational language of the web.

(b). It's used to create and structure websites.

(c). HTML defines the barebone structure or layout of web pages that we see on the Internet.

(d). By utilizing HTML tags, we can define the appearance and layout of a website. 
With a good grasp of these tags and their proper usage, creating beautiful websites becomes straightforward and efficient!

(e). HTML consists of a set of tags contained within an HTML document, and the associated files typically have either a ".html" or ".htm" extension.

(f). There are several versions of HTML, with HTML5 being the most recent version.


---------------------------------------------------------Features of HTML--------------------------------------------------------------------

1. It is platform-independent. 
For example, Chrome displays the same pages identically across different operating systems such as Mac, Linux, and Windows.

2. Images, videos, and audio can be added to a web page (For example - YouTube shows videos on their website)

3. HTML is a markup language and not a programming language.

4. It can be integrated with other languages like CSS, JavaScript, etc. to show interactive (or dynamic) web pages.


------------------------------------------------Why the Term HyperText & Markup Language?----------------------------------------------------------

The term 'Hypertext Markup Language' is composed of two main words: 'hypertext' and 'markup language.' 
'Hypertext' refers to the linking of text with other documents, while 'markup language' denotes a language that utilizes a specific set of tags.
Thus, HTML is the practice of displaying text, graphics, audio, video etc. in a certain way using special tags.

NOTE: 
Tags are meaningful texts enclosed in angle braces, like '<...>'. 
For example, the '<head>' tag. 
Each tag has a unique meaning and significance in building an HTML page, and it can influence the web page in various ways.


------------------------------------A beautiful analogy to understand HTML, CSS, and JavaScript:------------------------------------------

In building a webpage, think of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as different parts of a car. 
HTML is like the car's skeleton, forming the basic structure and frame. 
CSS adds the paint and finishing touches, making the car look appealing with color, style, and design. 
JavaScript is similar to the engine and mechanical parts, infusing the car with functionality, movement, and interactive features. 

ðŸ”¹ HTML = Car body (only metal)  

ðŸ”¹ CSS = Car paint, decoration etc.

ðŸ”¹ JavaScript = Car engine + Interior logic (like steering, brakes etc.)

HTML is used to define the layout of a page, providing a barebone structure for the content. 

CSS is used to add styling to that barebone page created using HTML. 

JavaScript is used to program logic for the page layout e.g. What happens when a user hovers on a text, when to hide or show elements etc.

HTML is the foundation of web development, CSS is the beauty, and JavaScript is the logic behind the functionality of the website.
