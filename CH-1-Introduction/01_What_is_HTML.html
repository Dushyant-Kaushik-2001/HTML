----------------------------------------------------------What is HTML?------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language.

2. HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages.

3. HTML describes the structure of a Web page.

4. HTML consists of a series of elements.

5. HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content.

6. HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph", "this is a link", etc.

7. HTML, which stands for "HyperText Markup Language," is the foundational language of the web. 
It's used to create and structure websites. By utilizing HTML tags, we can define the appearance and layout of a website. 
With a good grasp of these tags and their proper usage, creating beautiful websites becomes straightforward and efficient!

THEN WHY CSS &  JAVASCRIPT?
HTML is used to define the layout of a page, providing a barebone structure for the content. 
CSS is used to add styling to that barebone page created using HTML. 
JavaScript is used to program logic for the page layout e.g. What happens when a user hovers on a text, when to hide or show elements etc.
HTML is the foundation of web development, CSS is the beauty, and JavaScript is the logic behind the functionality of the website.

8. A BEAUTIFUL ANALOGY: 
â€¢ HTML = Car body (only metal)   
â€¢ CSS = Car paint, decoration etc.  
â€¢ JavaScript = Car engine + Interior logic (like steering, brakes etc.)
